## Note to Coding Club members
  Once you have made a pull request and it has been accepted, try to add more features to your part of the website,
  once a pull request has been made, it doesn't mean it's all over. Add more features, or try to streamline some of 
  the styles to make it cleaner. *There is always a way to make a project better.*
